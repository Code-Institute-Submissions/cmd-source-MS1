## UX
### Project Goals

The main project goals for this developement are (1) For the sites owners to attract and retain customers to their gym website FITFIT. (2) For members of the gym and potential members who want to know more about the gym and its proceedures.

Owners goals
- Make it as easy as possible to sign up to the gym
- Make it as appealing as possible through attractive visuals
- Retain members through price value 

Members/Potential members goals
- To find a gym for the best price and to sign up as easily as possible
- To find the location and opening hours easily 
- To find a timetable of the classes available


### User Stories

As an owner of this gym website I want:

1. Ease of use for a potential gym member in being able to sign up from the moment they land on the site to the stage of signing up. Which means the website must flow from the landing page to the sign up page with minimum clicks needed.

2. For anyone who lands on the page to get the impression that this is a high quality gym and one that they would want to be part of. To make it as appealing as possible through attractive visuals.

3. To retain members for longer periods of time. This can be accomplished at the beginning through informative and obvious price value. It can then be maintained through clear opening times, contact details and obvious class times.


As a gym user/potential user I want:

1. To get the impression that I am dealing with a quality gym that will meet my needs. This means that I can come as I please to do my own workout or have the option to attend classes if I wish.

2. To be able to locate the gym and find its opening times easily. 

3. To know that I am getting value for my money. I also want to have the option to make a serious commitment in signing up for a long time or to have the option to sign uo for shorter durations. This gives me flexibility.

4. Ease in signing up once I have decided that I like the look and feel of this gym. I should not have to struggle to find the sign up form.


### Design

When someone thinks of a gym or a place of physical fitness they imagine deep breathing, sweat, movement and physical edurance in a way that makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. With that in mind the following was selected to be part of the design:

### Images 
A strong background image was selected that immediately gives the immpressive of an areana for physical work to announce to the user that they are at the right place.

A gallary of images to show that all people of various types and exercises have a place here in FITFIT.

### Video

To give the sense that the user has already begun their training or workout with FITFIT, a short video with two men in a session of training was selected to autoplay on the homepage once the user first lands on the site.

### Styling

The theme of colours for this site is dark, grey and white. It was selected as it gives the user an impression that this is a serious place where serious physical accomplishments are made.


### Wireframes

- [The homepage](assets/wireframes/homepagewire.PNG)

## Features

Included
 - A fixed nav-bar at the top of the page allows the user to navigate easily
 - A footer at the bottom of the page allows the user to contact owners and also provides the links to their social media.
 - The location on Google Maps was included at the bottom of the homepage to allow the user to easily locate the FITFIT gym.
 - A video on the homepage was inserted to give the user a positive emotional response.
 - A signup form has been inserted which is the end goal for new users coming to the FITFIT site. The input fields call for the users personal info and payment details.
 - There are a number of mid sized buttons which first call to the user leading them from the homepage, through the choice between the two membership options and finally to the signup page.
 - 
 
Not Included
 - Autoplay audio/music was considered for the homepage, but after review it was considered to be too annoying and would actually take away from the experience when the user first lands.
 - For future developement it might be add a more personal experience to include a page on the site for the purpose of introducing the trainers and FITFIT team.

## Testing

### Homepage

##### For Desktop / Tablet
 1. The homepage displays as intended when the user lands.
 2. A clear call to action incites the user to join the gym and the Join Button transitions in its annimation when the user hovers
 3. The video begins to autoplay, however I've noticed that sometimes it takes a few moments to begin playing. The video is hidden as intended on screen sizes smaller then a desktop.

##### For Mobile
 1. The homepage appears to work as intended except for the Opening Hours being slightly pushed to the right side of the screen, I havent yet solved this.


### Join page

##### For Desktop / Tablet
 1. The options for either One Years Membership or Monthly Recurring Membership present well side by side on the desktop and tablet. This allows for easy comparison of price.
 2. Both Join Now buttons display and transition in their annimation as intended when the user hovers over them.

 ##### For Mobile
 1. The options for either One Years Membership or Monthly Recurring Membership stack on top of each other in the mobile version. The One Years Membership stacks on top and is presented as the first option as this is what we would prefer the user to chose.
 2. Both options display as originally intended from the wireframes.


 ### Timetable page
 ##### For Desktop / Tablet
 1. Click on the Timetable in the nav-bar
 2. The Timetable displays as intended on desktop with each day of the week bein side by side in parallel.
 3. On a tablet the days of the week stack on top of each other as intended.

 ##### For Mobile
 1. Click on the Timetable in the nav-bar
 2. Like the tablet the days of the week stack on top of each other as intended.

### Gallary page
##### For Desktop / Tablet
 1. Click on the Gallary in the nav-bar.
 2. The images render well on the desktop in two columns.
 3. The images are not optimal on the table. Currnetly looking at how I might optimize them.

##### For Desktop / Tablet
 1. Click on the Timetable in the nav-bar
 2. The images render very well on the mobile in one column.
 3. The images do slightly lean to the right, I am currently investigating this.
