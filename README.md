### User Stories

As an owner of this gym website I want:

1. Ease of use for a potential gym in being able to sign up from the moment they land on the site to the stage of signing up. Which means the website must flow from the landing page to the sign up page with minimum clicks needed.

2. For anyone who lands on the page to get the impression that this is a high quality gym and one that they would want to be part of. To make it as appealing as possible through attractive visuals

3. To retain members for longer periods of time. This can be accoplished through informative and obvious price valuations and comparisions.


As a gym user/potentisl user I want:

1. To get the impression that I am dealing with a quality gym that will meet my needs. This means I can come as I please and have the option to attend classes if I wish

2. I must be able to locate the gym easily

3. I know that I am getting value for my money and to have the option to make a serious commitment in signing up for a long time or to be able to come and go as I like.

4. Ease in signing up once I have decided that I like the look and feel of this gym.


### Design

When someone thinks of a gym or a place of physical fitness they imagine deep breathing, sweat, movement and physical edurance in a way that makes you feel a sense of accomplishment. With that in mind the following was selected to be part of the design:

#### Images 
A strong background image that immediately gives the immpressive of an areana for physical work to announce to the user that they are at the right place.

A gallary of images to show that all people of various types and exercises have a place here.

#### Video

In or to give the sense of physical movement, almost as if you were already taking part in an exercise a video was selected to autoplay on the homepage.

#### Styling

The theme of colours for this site is dark, grey and white. It was selected as it gives the user an impression that this is a serious place where serious physical accomplishments are made.
